# cpm - the C Project Manager
The C Project Manager is a quick-and-slightly-dirty tool I created for quickly creating new C/C++ projects. It creates a folder directory that contains the folders `src`, `bin`, `include`, and `lib`.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Git
- A command prompt
- make
- A C++ compiler that `make` can find

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/IY314/cpm.git
cd cpm
make
```
